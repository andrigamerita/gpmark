GPmark v0.04 (GP2X)
------------------

This is the very first version of my benchmark for the gamepark and other similarly powered handhelds. At the moment there is a Caanoo, a Wiz and a GP2X version availiable. There will also be a Dingoo version soon and a Pandora when I get one in my hands :)


Tests included in this version:

- Simple blitting test
- Plasma test
- Rotozoomer
- Rotozoomer close up (not affected by cache)
- Rotozoomer far away (severly affected by cache)
- Radial Blur
- Heavy 3d bunny model


Things to do in the near future:

- ports
- much more tests
- saving results in file and comparing to other handhelds
- overclocking or memory tweaks options
- various other options for the tests (number of frames, frameskip, etc)
- 3d acceleration tests (for those handhelds who have it)
- maybe something I forgot


Enjoy this very early version.
